Boozey aims to provide common drinking game materials (ie. cards, dice, quarters, etc.) in
digital format to the end user through a mobile app. Drinking games are created via individual
script files which dictate the logic and rules of each game and how it should interact with the
core game assets. Thus, users (and developers) can create an endless supply of games by
writing new rules for the existing game assets and downloading the script file from their phone.
